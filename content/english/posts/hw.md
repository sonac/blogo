Hi, so I've decided that I don't like medium (to be honest for many reasons and their ridiculous 
paywall is just one of many) and that I'm gonna move my pathetic couple posts from it to a 
dedicated place. Maybe I'm gonna write something else here, I really hope so, but so far - no idea. 

Normally my posts are rather more like some sort of weird mindflow. It's not necessary bad, but 
for many people its just hard to read and I don't want for my writing to be only for myself. 
I have my odd brain for that purpose so it would be nice to write something that someone else would 
also find useful.

### So what is this? 

This is a collection of posts (I would refrain from calling it a blog) from a Software/Data Engineer 
who lives and works in Berlin (the one that is in Germany). I plan to write mostly about some tech 
stuff that I find useful to share or worth to note about, maybe for future me (sometimes I 
comeback to the same technology several times with quite an interval (looks at SFML) and each time 
I forget everything, so it would be useful to keep some sort of notes for myself).
Besides that since I have > 1 mechanical keyboard, I would feel obliged to share about that stuff 
as well.

My next post is gonna be obviously about how I've assembled this blog using hugo and deployed it 
via Netlify. Probably that's gonna be in some sort of guidy way, since I think it might be useful.
I personally had several bumps in the way, during it's deployment (I wasn't able to deploy it via
Vercel smh, which is a bit odd and that's why I've sticked with Netlify in the end) so hopefully
someone will find it also useful.

Well, I'll wrap this up here, since I don't want to make my hi being too long and too boring. Cya.
