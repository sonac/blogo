Hi, so I've decided that I don't like medium (to be honest for many reasons and their ridiculous paywall is just one of many) and that I'm gonna move my pathetic couple posts from it to a dedicated place. Maybe I'm gonna write something else here, I really hope so, but so far - no idea. 

Normally my posts are rather more like some sort of weird mindflow. It's not necessary bad, but for many people its just hard to read and I don't want for my writing to be only for myself. I have my odd brain for that purpose so it would be nice to write something that someone else would also find useful.

So what is this? 

This is a collection of posts (I would refrain from calling it a blog) from a Software/Data Engineer who lives and works in Berlin (the one that is in Germany). I plan to write mostly about some tech stuff that I find useful to share or worth to note about, maybe for future me (sometimes I comeback to the same technology several times with quite an interval (looks at SFML) and each time I forget everything, so it would be useful to keep some sort of notes for myself).
Besides that since I have > 1 mechanical keyboard, I would feel obliged to share about that stuff as well.
